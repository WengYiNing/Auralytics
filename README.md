Auralytics is an open-source project designed to provide in-depth insights into users' Spotify listening habits. By leveraging Spotify's API, Auralytics visualizes users' most frequently played tracks, albums, and genres over different time periods.

The production version of Auralytics is available at:  
[**Auralytics Production**](https://auralytics.com)

This repository contains the **open-source local version**, which allows developers to run Auralytics locally and contribute improvements. We actively review and merge valuable contributions into the production environment. Your contributions help enhance Auralytics for the entire community.

2. Log in with your Spotify account.
3. Click **Create an App**.
4. Fill in the required details and agree to Spotify‚Äôs terms.
5. Once created, go to **Dashboard** and click on your app.
6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
7. Add these credentials to the project's `.env` files (see below).

For a more detailed guide, visit the [Spotify API Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).
