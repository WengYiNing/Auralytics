Auralytics is an open-source project designed to provide in-depth insights into users' Spotify listening habits. By leveraging Spotify's API, Auralytics visualizes users' most frequently played tracks, albums, and genres over different time periods.

The production version of Auralytics is available at:  [**https://auralyticsmusic.com/**](https://auralyticsmusic.com/)

This repository contains the **open-source local version**, which allows developers to run Auralytics locally and contribute improvements. We actively review and merge valuable contributions into the production environment. Your contributions help enhance Auralytics for the entire community.

## üóùÔ∏è Prerequisites: Obtaining Spotify Client ID & Client Secret

Auralytics relies on Spotify's API to fetch user data, so you will need a **Spotify Client ID** and **Client Secret** before running the project. Follow these steps to obtain them:

1. Go to [**Spotify for Developers**](https://developer.spotify.com/).
2. Log in with your Spotify account.
3. Go to [**Dashboard**](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
4. Click **Create app**.
5. Fill in the required details and agree to Spotify‚Äôs terms (Redirect URIs needs to be align with the REDIRECT_URI in .env for Backend).
6. Once created, go to **Dashboard** and click on your app.
7. Click "Settings".
8. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
9. Add these credentials to the project's `.env` files (see below).
